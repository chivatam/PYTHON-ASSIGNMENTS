1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*              - Expression
'hello'        - Value 
-87.8          - Value
-              - Expression
/              - Expression
+              - Expression
6              - Value

2. What is the difference between string and variable?
A string is a collection of characters or a text which is also a type of variable. Whereas, variable is an name to which a value is assigned. Variable can be an integer, string, double, boolean etc.

3. Describe three different data types.

Integer - integers value
boolean - True/false
list - an array of values

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
An expression is usually a mathematical operator or an algebraic expression made of various operators, variables and constants. Expression usually be evaluated by the interpreter and display the result.

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
The statement spam = 10, is a variable(spam) to which 10 was assigned. whereas, an expression would contain mathematical operators which could be a function of a variable.


6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

After running the above code, the variable bacon contains 22+1 = 23.


7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3

both of them would result in 'spamspamspam'.



8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

This is because eggs align with the convention rules which states that a variable cannot start with a number hence 100 is invalid


9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

int(), float(), and str() 

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'

In python or in any other language, one cannot concatnate a string and a number. In order to remove the error, we can replace 99 with str(99).
