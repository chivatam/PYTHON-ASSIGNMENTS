1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
True/False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
and, or, not

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
T and T is T
T and F is F
F and T is F
F and F is F
T or T is T
T or F is T
F or T is T
F or F is F
not F is T
not T is F

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                         False
not (5 > 4)                                  False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                          True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))                    False
(True and True) and (True == False)          False
(not False) or (not True)                    True


5. What are the six comparison operators?
==
!=
>
<
>=
<=

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.

== is used to get a boolean value for whether the LHS is equal to RHS. Whereas, = is used to assign RHS to the LHS variable. A condition is an expression to evaluate a boolean value which could be used during the control statements

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10: -- block 1
print('eggs')  --
if spam > 5:   -- block 2
print('bacon') --
else:          -- block 3
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')


8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam = input('enter the spam value: ')
if spam == 1:
  print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
  print('Howdy')
else:
  print('Greetings!')


9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Control + C


10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

Break statement will break the loop and starts executing the line after loop, whereas the continue statement will allow it to execute the loop.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

the syntax of range is range(start, stop, step). there for all the above mentioned once call the same function with more specific inputs.


12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.


x = range(1,11)
for n in x:
print(n)

i = 1;
while i < 11:
print(i)
i += 1



13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

spam.bacon()
